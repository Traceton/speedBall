A basic javascript game to be played for 20 seconds, with the goal being to bounce the ball on the paddle as many times as possible.

Uses the REST Api i created for my games, which holds the usernames and scores for a certain game. 

once you play this game, you can enter your username and hit "save score" and the username/score will be saved to the database,  and than
can be seen on the "check scores!" link.
